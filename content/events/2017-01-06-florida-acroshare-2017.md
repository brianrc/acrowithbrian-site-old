A weekend of fun in the sunshine state with all things acrobatic. Teachers from all over Florida and beyond have come together to give back and make a place to learn, play, and enjoy the Florida Acrobatics community. Handbalancing, AcroYoga, circus acrobatics, cheerleading, Tumbling, yoga, slackline and more will be offered at this fun acrobatic gathering.

I will be attending this.
