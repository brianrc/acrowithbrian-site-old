At Wanderlust, our mission is to help you find your true north— to lead a healthy & inspired life. Wanderlust Snowshoe, set in the heart of West Virginia's famed Pocahontas County is a step down that path. Choose your own adventure with multi-level yoga and meditation sessions, mouthwatering local organic dinners, heart-pumping music, inspiring lectures and workshops, and outdoor activities from SUP to scenic hiking with views of the Appalachian Trail.
