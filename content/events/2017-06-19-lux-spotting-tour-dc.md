We are excited to have Lux come to DC and share new Acro and Spotting techniques.

One area in Acro where we still need a significant amount of attention is safety, and in particular, proper spotting techniques. One of our next great challenges is to get smarter about the risks involved in this practice so that we can practice increasing complicated content, wisely and safely.

Lux does not preach that everything needs to be spotted. We will talk about the parameters of safety in a non-rigid real way.

When it comes to spotting, This will not be like most do it. The techniques used are unique, highly informed, and ultimately, effective.
For him, spotting is not a chore. It is active. It is integrated into what the base and flier are doing. It is a dance. It is a study. It is an art form.
It takes practice. It's unlikely you will be good at it when you first try. You will get better. It will be fun.

Cost for Spotting: $15. Yes that's right, $15 for 4 hours

Cost For Spotting and Acro: $30. Yes thats right $30 for 8 hours

Cost for Acro only: $100, yes that's right, better go back and do the spotting to save $70
